## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/) (Free Tier eligible)
- [Discord Server](https://discord.com/) with admin permissions

### Step 1: Create Discord Webhooks

1. Open your Discord server
2. Go to the channel where you want job listings to appear
3. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è (settings) icon ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
4. Click "New Webhook"
5. Give it a name (e.g., "Stockholm DevOps Jobs")
6. Copy the webhook URL - you'll need this later
7. Repeat for each location you want to track

### Step 2: Clone this Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linkedin-jobs-discord-bot.git
cd linkedin-jobs-discord-bot
```

### Step 3: Quick Setup

Use the setup script to create the necessary files:

```bash
# Make setup script executable
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh

# Run setup script
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The script will:
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies
3. Create Lambda layer ZIP file
4. Prompt for your Discord webhook URLs
5. Create configuration files

### Step 4: Test Locally (Optional)

Before deploying, you can test the bot locally:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run local test script
python scripts/local_test.py

# Or run the main script directly
python main.py
```

### Step 5: Deploy with Terraform

```bash
# Navigate to terraform directory
cd terraform

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Preview what will be created
terraform plan

# Deploy resources
terraform apply
```

Confirm the deployment by typing `yes`.

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

1. Check your Discord channels for test messages
2. The bot will now run automatically according to the schedule (daily at 9 AM UTC by default)
3. You can run it manually from the AWS Lambda console if you want

## Configuration

### Customize Job Searches

Edit `config.json` to modify your search parameters:

```json
{
  "job_searches": [
    {
      "keywords": "devops",
      "location": "stockholm",
      "webhook_url": "${STOCKHOLM_WEBHOOK_URL}"
    },
    {
      "keywords": "python developer",
      "location": "oslo",
      "webhook_url": "${OSLO_WEBHOOK_URL}"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can add as many search configurations as you need.

### Modify Schedule

To change how often the bot checks for jobs:

1. Edit `terraform/main.tf`
2. Find the `aws_cloudwatch_event_rule` resource
3. Modify the `schedule_expression` value (uses [cron syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule-schedule.html#eb-cron-expressions))

Example for running twice a day at 9 AM and 5 PM UTC:
```
schedule_expression = "cron(0 9,17 * * ? *)"
```

## AWS Free Tier Usage

This bot is designed to stay within AWS Free Tier limits:
- **Lambda**: Free Tier includes 1M free requests and 400,000 GB-seconds per month
- **DynamoDB**: Free Tier includes 25 GB of storage
- **CloudWatch Events**: No charge for scheduled events

Running once per day with minimal processing, this bot should cost $0 within the Free Tier.

### Cost Monitoring

1. Set up AWS Budget Alerts:
   - Go to AWS Billing Dashboard
   - Click "Budgets" ‚Üí "Create budget"
   - Select "Zero spend budget" to get alerts on any charges
   - Set email notifications

## Troubleshooting

- **No jobs appearing?**
  - Check that your webhook URLs are correct
  - Verify your search terms aren't too specific
  - Check AWS Lambda CloudWatch logs for errors

- **Duplicate jobs appearing?**
  - The DynamoDB table might need to be cleared
  - Run: `aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name LinkedInJobsPosted` and redeploy

- **Terraform errors?**
  - Make sure you have the latest Terraform version
  - Check that your AWS credentials are set up correctly

## Uninstalling

To remove all AWS resources:

```bash
cd terraform
terraform destroy
```

Confirm by typing `yes`.
